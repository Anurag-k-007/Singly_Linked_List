# Singly Linked List

[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Java-orange)](https://www.java.com/)

A Java application implementing a Singly Linked List with operations such as deletion of a node, insertion of a node, and calculating the length of the list.

## Key Features and Highlights
- Perform deletion and insertion operations on nodes in a Singly Linked List.
- Calculate the length of the Singly Linked List efficiently.
- Utilizes Java for implementation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Singly_Linked_List.git
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac SinglyLinkedList.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java SinglyLinkedList
   ```

## Usage
1. Initialize a new Singly Linked List:
   ```java
   SinglyLinkedList myList = new SinglyLinkedList();
   ```
2. Insert a node at the beginning:
   ```java
   myList.insertAtBeginning(data);
   ```
3. Delete a node:
   ```java
   myList.deleteNode(data);
   ```
4. Get the length of the list:
   ```java
   int length = myList.getLength();
   ```

## Dependencies
- No external dependencies required.
