# Singly Linked List

This repository provides an implementation of a **Singly Linked List** in C++. It contains the fundamental operations required to understand and work with linked lists, which are one of the most important linear data structures in computer science.

---

## 📌 Features
- Create a singly linked list.
- Insert nodes at:
  - Beginning
  - End
  - Specific position
- Delete nodes from:
  - Beginning
  - End
  - Specific position
- Display the linked list.
- Search for an element.
- Count the number of nodes.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (g++, clang, MSVC, etc.)

### Compilation & Execution
```bash
# Compile
g++ main.cpp linkedlist.cpp -o linkedlist

# Run
./linkedlist
```

---

## 📖 Example Usage
```cpp
LinkedList list;
list.insertAtEnd(10);
list.insertAtEnd(20);
list.insertAtBeginning(5);
list.display();
// Output: 5 -> 10 -> 20
```
